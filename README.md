# National Park Geek
This was a mini capstone project on the 8th week of Tech Elevator. We were given 2 days and 1 other partner to complete a National Park Weather System. Some of the code is admittedly messy and was a great learning experience. We choose to learn Bootstrap for this project to try and make the website more mobile friendly. 

To Run: 
create a copy of the sql database via the "SchemeAndData.sql" file located in "etc".
Open the solution and run the prgram.
